# Java Programs 

This repository contains a collection of Java programs covering various topics including arrays, strings, star patterns, searching and sorting algorithms, as well as matrix manipulation. Below is a brief introduction to the types of code you can find in this repository:

## 1. Arrays
This section includes Java programs that demonstrate various operations on arrays such as finding maximum and minimum elements, calculating the sum and average of elements, reversing arrays, sorting arrays, and more. These programs showcase fundamental array manipulation techniques.

## 2. Strings
In this section, you'll find Java programs that deal with string manipulation. This includes programs for reversing strings, checking for palindrome strings, counting occurrences of characters, finding the longest common prefix, and other string-related tasks.

## 3. Star Patterns
This section contains Java programs that generate different patterns of stars (*) using nested loops. These patterns range from simple shapes like triangles and squares to more complex designs like pyramids and diamond patterns.

## 4. Searching and Sorting
Here, you'll find Java programs implementing various searching and sorting algorithms. Searching algorithms include linear search, binary search, and more. Sorting algorithms cover popular methods such as bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quick sort.

## 5. Matrix Manipulation
This section includes Java programs for performing operations on matrices. These programs demonstrate matrix addition, subtraction, multiplication, transposition, finding the determinant of a matrix, and more.

Each program is accompanied by comments explaining the logic and functionality, making it easier for learners to understand and modify the code as needed.
